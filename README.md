# Airport Simulation

An airport simulation written in C++. Currently a work in progress, when finished, the airport should 
have working ATC, perfectly capable of controlling air traffic and safely guiding and landing aircraft. 
Aircraft and ATC should take multiple outside effects into account, including but not limited to weather, 
emergency situations, wake turbulence, etc. and prevent aircraft from crashing into one another both 
on ground and in the air. The ATC should also be capable of handling situations such as temporarily 
closed runways, opening of new runways, etc.

There are currently two versions of the airport simulation on my GitHub account, one written in Kotlin, one in C++.
I started writing it in Kotlin, but upon realization Swing might not be the best framework for such a program,
I decided to try to create something using SFML, which, so far, seems much better fitted for what I need it to do.
I might yet realize Kotlin was the right choice and stick to Kotlin in the end, or I may decide to stick with C++ and SFML,
who nows.
